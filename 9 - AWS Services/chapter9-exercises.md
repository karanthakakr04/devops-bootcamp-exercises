# TASK BREAKDOWN

## Exercise 1

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **The IAM user created in this exercise should only have the necessary permissions to perform their required tasks. Avoid using overly permissive policies such as `AdministratorAccess`.**

- [ ] **Task 1: Login to AWS Management Console**
  - Open your web browser.
  - Navigate to the [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/).
  - Click on the _Sign in to the Console_ button.
  - Enter your admin username and password.
  - Click on _Sign In_.

- [ ] **Task 2: Navigate to IAM Service**
  - On the AWS Management Console home page, you can either:
    - Find _IAM_ under the _Security, Identity, & Compliance_ section and click on it, or
    - Use the search bar at the top to search for _IAM_ and click on the _IAM_ result.
  - In the IAM dashboard, click on _Users_ in the left sidebar.
  - Click on the _Create user_ button.

- [ ] **Task 3: Enter user details**
  - On the _Specify user details_ page:
    - You will be presented with two options:
      - _AWS IAM Identity Center_
      - _IAM User_
    - Select _IAM User_ to create a new IAM user.
    - _User name:_ Enter a desired username for the IAM user (e.g., "dev-user"). Replace "dev-user" with your preferred username.
    - Check the _Provide user access to the AWS Management Console_ option.
    - Under _Are you providing console access to a person?_, select _I want to create an IAM user_.
    - _Console password:_ Select "Autogenerated password".
    - _Password reset required:_ Keep the _User must create a new password at next sign-in_ option selected.
    - Click on _Next_ button.

> [!NOTE]
> **AWS recommends using AWS IAM Identity Center for centralized access management and short-term credentials. However, for this exercise, we will use _IAM User_ as it is within the scope of our demonstration. For more information, refer to the [AWS IAM Identity Center User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/introduction_identity-management.html#intro-identity-users). You can also watch this [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KhrGFV_Npw) for a detailed setup of AWS IAM Identity Center.**

- [ ] **Task 4: Assign permissions to the IAM user**
  - On the _Set permissions_ page, you will see three options to set permissions:
    - _Add user to group_
    - _Copy permissions from existing user_
    - _Attach policies directly_
  - AWS recommends adding the user to a group and then attaching policies to the group. Select _Add user to group_.
  - Click on _Create group_.
    - _Group name:_ Enter `devops`.
    - In the _Filter policies_ box, type relevant policies based on the permissions the user needs. Avoid using overly permissive policies such as `AdministratorAccess`.
    - Consider policies like:
      - _AmazonEC2FullAccess_ - For managing EC2 instances.
      - _AmazonVPCFullAccess_ - For managing VPCs, subnets, and security groups.
      - _CloudWatchFullAccess_ - For logging and monitoring.
      - _AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess_ - For read-only access to S3 buckets (if needed for storing/retrieving objects).
    - Click the _Create group_ button.
  - Ensure the new user is added to the `devops` group.
  - Click on _Next_ button.

- [ ] **Task 5: Finalize and create the IAM user**
  - On the _Review and create_ page:
    - Review the user details and permissions.
    - Optionally, add tags to the IAM user for better organization and management. Here are some suggested tags:
      - Project: DevOpsBootcamp
      - Role: NodeJSAppDeployment
      - Environment: Development
      - Department: Engineering
      - CreatedBy: Admin
      - CreationDate: 2024-05-19
    - If everything looks correct, click on the _Create user_ button.

- [ ] **Task 6: Save IAM user credentials**
  - You will be presented with the _Step 4: Retrieve password_ page.
  - Click on the _Download .csv_ button to download the credentials file, which contains the access key ID, secret access key, and password for the IAM user.
  - Store the downloaded file securely, as it contains sensitive information.
  - Click on the _Return to users list_ button.

> [!WARNING]
> **Make sure to store the downloaded .csv file containing the IAM user credentials securely. Do not share or expose the credentials publicly, as they provide access to your AWS resources.**

## Exercise 2

- [ ] **Task 1: Install AWS CLI**
  - Go to the [AWS CLI installation guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html), choose the appropriate installation method for your operating system, and follow the provided installation instructions.
  - Verify the installation by running:

    ```bash
    aws --version
    ```

- [ ] **Task 2: Configure AWS CLI with IAM user credentials**
  - Run the following command to configure AWS CLI:

    ```bash
    aws configure
    ```

  - Provide the following information when prompted:
    - AWS Access Key ID: Enter the access key ID obtained from Exercise 1.
    - AWS Secret Access Key: Enter the secret access key obtained from Exercise 1.
    - Default region name: Enter the desired AWS region (e.g., us-east-1).
    - Default output format: Press Enter to use the default format (json).

- [ ] **Task 3: Verify AWS CLI configuration**
  - Run the following command to verify the configured credentials:

    ```bash
    aws sts get-caller-identity
    ```

  - Run the following command to verify the configured region and output format:

    ```bash
    aws configure list
    ```

## Exercise 3

- [ ] **Task 1: Create a new VPC**
  - Run the following command to create a new VPC:

    ```bash
    aws ec2 create-vpc --cidr-block 10.0.0.0/16 --tag-specifications 'ResourceType=vpc,Tags=[{Key=Name,Value=my-vpc}]' --query Vpc.VpcId --output text
    ```

  - Take note of the VPC ID returned by the command.

- [ ] **Task 2: Create a subnet within the VPC**
  - Run the following command to create a subnet within the VPC:

    ```bash
    aws ec2 create-subnet --vpc-id <VPC_ID> --cidr-block 10.0.1.0/24 --availability-zone <AVAILABILITY_ZONE> --tag-specifications 'ResourceType=subnet,Tags=[{Key=Name,Value=my-subnet}]' --query Subnet.SubnetId --output text
    ```

  - Replace `<vpc-id>` with the VPC ID obtained in Task 1.
  - Take note of the Subnet ID returned by the command.

- [ ] **Task 3: Create a security group**
  - Run the following command to create a security group:

    ```bash
    aws ec2 create-security-group --group-name my-sg --description "My security group" --vpc-id <VPC_ID> --tag-specifications 'ResourceType=security-group,Tags=[{Key=Name,Value=my-sg}]' --query GroupId --output text
    ```

  - Replace `<vpc-id>` with the VPC ID obtained in Task 1.
  - Take note of the Security Group ID returned by the command.

- [ ] **Task 4: Configure Security Group Rules**
  - Run the following command to allow inbound SSH (port 22) access from a specific IP address or range:
  
    ```bash
    aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress --group-id <SECURITY_GROUP_ID> --protocol tcp --port 22 --cidr <YOUR_IP_ADDRESS>/32
    ```

  - Replace `<SECURITY_GROUP_ID>` with the Security Group ID from Task 3.
  - Replace `<YOUR_IP_ADDRESS>` with your specific IP address or the IP range you want to allow SSH access from. For example, if your IP address is `203.0.113.0`, you would use `203.0.113.0/32`. If you want to allow access from a range, you can use a subnet mask like `203.0.113.0/24`.
  - Run the following command to allow inbound HTTP (port 80) access:

    ```bash
    aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress --group-id <SECURITY_GROUP_ID> --protocol tcp --port 80 --cidr 0.0.0.0/0
    ```

## Exercise 4

- [ ] **Task 1: Create Key Pair**
  - Run the following command to create a new key pair:

    ```bash
    aws ec2 create-key-pair --key-name my-key --query 'KeyMaterial' --output text > my-key.pem
    ```

  - This command creates a new key pair named "my-key" and saves the private key to a file named "my-key.pem" in the current directory.
  - For Linux and MacOS, secure the key pair file by running the following command:

    ```bash
    chmod 400 my-key.pem
    ```

- [ ] **Task 2: Get the Latest Amazon Linux 2 AMI ID**
  - Run the following command to retrieve the latest Amazon Linux 2 AMI ID:

    ```bash
    aws ssm get-parameters --names /aws/service/ami-amazon-linux-latest/amzn2-ami-hvm-x86_64-gp2 --region <REGION> --query 'Parameters[0].[Value]' --output text
    ```

  - Replace `<REGION>` with your desired AWS region (e.g., us-east-1).
  - Save the AMI ID returned by the command.

- [ ] **Task 3: Create EC2 Instance**
  - Run the following command to create an EC2 instance:

    ```bash
    aws ec2 run-instances --image-id <AMI_ID> --instance-type t2.micro --key-name my-key --security-group-ids <SECURITY_GROUP_ID> --subnet-id <SUBNET_ID> --tag-specifications 'ResourceType=instance,Tags=[{Key=Name,Value=my-instance}]' --block-device-mappings '[{"DeviceName":"/dev/xvda","Ebs":{"VolumeSize":8,"VolumeType":"gp3","DeleteOnTermination":true,"Encrypted":true}}]' --metadata-options '{"HttpTokens":"required","HttpPutResponseHopLimit":1,"HttpEndpoint":"enabled"}' --query 'Instances[0].InstanceId' --output text
    ```

  - Replace `<AMI_ID>` with the AMI ID from Task 2.
  - Replace `<SECURITY_GROUP_ID>` with the Security Group ID from Exercise 3, Task 3.
  - Replace `<SUBNET_ID>` with the Subnet ID from Exercise 3, Task 2.
  - The command uses the `t2.micro` instance type, which is eligible for the free tier.
  - The `--block-device-mappings` option specifies the EBS volume configuration, including the volume size (8 GB), volume type (gp2), and encryption.
  - The `--metadata-options` option configures the instance metadata service to require token-based access and limit the number of hops.
  - Save the Instance ID returned by the command.

- [ ] **Task 4: Verify EC2 Instance Creation**
  - Run the following command to describe the EC2 instance:

    ```bash
    aws ec2 describe-instances --instance-ids <INSTANCE_ID>
    ```

  - Replace `<INSTANCE_ID>` with the Instance ID from Task 3.
  - Review the output to ensure the instance details are correct, such as the VPC, subnet, security group, and key pair.

- [ ] **Task 5: Retrieve Public IP Address**
  - Run the following command to retrieve the public IP address of the EC2 instance:

    ```bash
    aws ec2 describe-instances --instance-ids <INSTANCE_ID> --query 'Reservations[0].Instances[0].PublicIpAddress' --output text
    ```

  - Replace `<INSTANCE_ID>` with the Instance ID from Task 3.
  - Save the public IP address for connecting to the instance via SSH in Exercise 5.

This refined task list incorporates the following best practices:

- Using the latest Amazon Linux 2 AMI ID retrieved via AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store.
- Configuring the EBS volume with encryption and appropriate size and type.
- Configuring the instance metadata service to require token-based access and limit the number of hops.
- Using the `t2.micro` instance type, which is eligible for the free tier.

## Exercise 5

- [ ] Task 1: SSH into the EC2 instance
  - Run the following command to retrieve the public IP address of the EC2 instance:

    ```bash
    aws ec2 describe-instances --instance-ids <instance-id> --query 'Reservations[].Instances[].PublicIpAddress' --output text
    ```

  - Replace `<instance-id>` with the Instance ID obtained in Exercise 4.
  - Use the public IP address to SSH into the EC2 instance:

    ```bash
    ssh -i mykey.pem ec2-user@<public-ip>
    ```

  - Replace `<public-ip>` with the public IP address obtained in the previous step.

- [ ] Task 2: Install Docker on the EC2 instance
  - Once connected to the EC2 instance via SSH, run the following commands to install Docker:

    ```bash
    sudo yum update -y
    sudo amazon-linux-extras install docker -y
    sudo service docker start
    sudo usermod -a -G docker ec2-user
    ```

  - These commands update the package manager, install Docker, start the Docker service, and add the `ec2-user` to the `docker` group.

- [ ] Task 3: Verify Docker installation
  - Log out and log back in to the EC2 instance for the group membership changes to take effect.
  - Run the following command to verify that Docker is installed and running correctly:

    ```bash
    docker --version
    ```

  - The command should display the Docker version installed.

> [!NOTE]
> **After completing this exercise, the EC2 instance is now ready to run the dockerized application from Exercise 1.**
>
> **Remember to stop or terminate the EC2 instance when you are done to avoid incurring unnecessary charges.**
